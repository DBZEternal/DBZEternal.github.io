#### Martial Artists

Martial Artists are the elite of their kind, who have taken the martial arts to incredible levels. Whereas, most races have a basic understanding of Ki from birth, humans have to work to grasp even the smallest understanding of it. However, those that do are known to be just as strong as the strongest warriors from races born with the most intricate knowledge of the arts. As such, these humans are renowned for their mastery of Ki and special martial arts schools. Many are sought out to be learned from.

Furthermore, humans are the most populous race in the universe. Having been one of the first races to develop intergalactic travel, their numbers spread across the universe. It is rare to find a world not inhabited by humans. Even stranger is the fact that some planets, such as Bayushi, were already populated by humans for generations before anyone from Earth stepped foot on it. Perhaps, there is something special about what caused the evolution of humans, which causes it to reproduce itself so often elsewhere?

‐--------------------------------

Martial artists have +5% Bonus XP.

-=[ Martial Artist Aura ]=-
Trained fighters fundamentally utilize Ki and become more proficient with it to perform superhuman feats, but Martial Artists are capable of tapping into truly impressive feats of its usage, turning their energy into a shield to withstand otherwise lethal injuries.

 - Base Cost: 0  
 - Scale: 1  
 - Limit: KI/10  

With this ability, you can choose to, in response to taking damage from an attack, reduce that damage by (KI/5) * X, by increasing your Ki Exhaustion penalty by X.  X’s maximum is the number of ranks of this ability you have. 

If you increase your Ki Exhaustion penalty beyond (KI/8) by doing this, you automatically advance a fatigue level (e.g., with a Ki of 80, increasing your Ki Exhaustion beyond -10 would automatically advance you a fatigue level after doing so).

You may additionally elect to use this ability as a Speed 0 Interrupt in response to being Wounded. By spending a Willpower, you can negate the Wound entirely–you simply don’t suffer it, don’t have to recover from it, and so forth.

-=[ Expansive Ki ]=- 
Martial Artists are more in tune with the natural Ki around them than most, and make use of it when fighting to be capable of recovering their energies continuously throughout a battle.

 - Base Cost: 10  
 - Scale: 10  
 - Limit: 1 +XP/1000  

For every rank of this ability you have, every 25 full IC which passes while you are fighting, you reduce your current Ki Exhaustion penalty by 1. This can not bring your penalty above 0.

-=[ Ki Discipline ]=-
By moderating how much energy they use and not going "full force" at all times, Martial Artists can greatly extend their training times and pace themselves against opponents who might try to tire them out.

 - Base Cost: 5  
 - Scale: 0  
 - Limit: KI/30  

For every rank you have, you can reduce your Base Ki Damage Bonus for an attack by 1 to decrease the penalty you receive from a successful Ki Exhaustion roll by 1, to a minimum of -0. Using any rank of this ability halves the base damage of the technique (e.g., (Base dice)/2+Speed*(KDB-X).
