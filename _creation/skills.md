Skills represent broad areas of ability and learning, and how well your character can make use of what they know.

All skills have a limit of 5 + (Total XP/200) ranks, and require you to spend Skill Points (SP) to gain ranks in them, spending one SP to gain one rank.

You start with 5 Skill Points, and get 1 Skill Point for every 40 XP you gain; this happens automatically, for free, and you cannot buy more Skill Points.

For example, if you had 600 XP you would have a totla of (5 + 600/25) = 29 Skill Points, and you could raise any of your skills up to rank ( 5 + 600/200 ) = 8.

Skills have associated 'skill rolls', which are a 1d20 + (skill ranks) in the skill you are using with that roll. Even if you haven't raised a skill beyond zero, you may still make a plain 1d20 roll when attempting to perform a task that would call for that skill.

##### Athletics (ATH)
<!-- Hand to Hand -->
This measures your general athleticism and physical martial arts prowess, and is most important for those that wish to focus on hand to hand combat.

##### Aura (AUR)
<!-- Ki Body Enhancement, Powering Up -->
You use this skill to manipulate your own energy in short bursts of power, and to regather general from the environment when your own reserves begin to run low.

##### Defensive Ki Control (DKC)
<!-- Defensive Ki -->
Your ability to utilize your Ki to protect yourself from harm.

##### Flight (FLT)
<!-- Flight, Super Speed -->
Your ability to fly, both in terms of pure speed and maneuverability in combat.  If you want to be able to escape pursuit (or pursue others), you will want to hone your ability to fly.

##### Offensive Ki Control (OKC)
<!-- Offensive Ki -->
This measures how well you can use Ki to inflict harm upon others, be it with beams or blast by showering the enemy with a homing storm of Ki.

##### Intuition (INT)
<!-- Ki Awareness, Telekinetics -->
Your ability to intuit what might be going on around you, to see through deceptions and a measure of how well you hone your mind.  Psionics, powers that come from your (and affect other's) minds, are derived from your Intuition.

##### Toughness (TGH)
<!-- Defensive -->
A measure of how well you can take punishment and protect yourself physically.

##### Weaponry (WPN)
<!-- Weapons -->
Skill with weapons of all kinds.  Though Swords are the most common, staffs and guns and all manner of weapons are better understood with this skill.
