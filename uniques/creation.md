Creation uniques cost 1 UP each, and may only be taken when you first create your character. You can take a maximum of two Creation Uniques.

##### Berserker
It takes a while to truly get you angry.  But when it happens, you tend to explode and punch holes where there used to be none.  Maybe it's because you like pain.  Maybe it's because you really, really don't.  Whatever the case, you're very good at laying the hurt on people.

You deal 10% more damage with all attacks. The first time you are reduced below 50% of your maximum Vitality in a battle, you recover ( RES + CHA ) Vitality, and your damage bonus increases by 15%, to 25% total. 

When you are attacked, you can opt to respond with "Fury Counter", a Speed 0 Defense. So long as the attack does not incapacitate you, you can then immediately attack the person who attacked you as an Interupt using any attack you know, with the following changes:
 - Your Interrupt attack has +3 to its Accuracy and is made at half its normal Speed, and cannot have its Speed reduced further.
 - Its Base Speed can not be greater than the Speed of the attack you used Fury Counter against to trigger it.

No surrender mechanics?

##### Brawler
You're just a good fighter. You know how to take and you know how to dish it out. You like to get in fights and beat people up.  It's time to shut up or nut up!

 - All your Hand to Hand attacks gain (STR/20) extra dice for damage, to a maximum of double their normal dice.
 - You have +3 to your Grapple rolls.
 - All your Hand to Hand attacks reduce their Stamina penalty from successfull Stamina rolls by 1, to a minimum of 0.

##### Extremely Strong
You're a brute with layers upon layers of muscle. You lift mountains with your bare hands! Or you could, if they weren't still a part of the ground and everything. Your favorite thing to ask puny others is 'do you even lift, brah?'

 - You use STR/12, rather than STR/15, to calculate your Physical Damage Bonus
 - You gain STR/4 Damage Reduction
 - You begin with the Parry Blast power, and it is Speed ? for you.

##### Goon
Predating what you think it means now, it means "a violent, aggressive person who is hired to intimidate or harm people." So, you're a big person. People like to make fun of that or make out like you're stupid, but you just take center stage.

 - You can choose to use Block at its normal Base Speed and reduce the damage by /2.5 (instead of /2), or you can choose to utilize Block as a Speed 2 Defense (with the normal /2 divisor).
 - You gain RES/4 Damage Reduction
 - You treat any damage you take as 10% lower for Wounding (though the actual damage dealt to you is unchanged).

 ##### Master of Blades
 You are very adept at using weapons in combat. You can pick up a blade and within seconds know just where its weighted and how to turn it into a lethal weapon. Like a nerd who knows the grit sharpness and weight of any weapon they pick up just by a look and a feel.

 - You gain +2 Accuracy with Weapons.
 - Your Weapon attacks deal twice as much Sharp Damage as normal, up to a maximum of your PDB.

##### Small
You are very quick and speedy. You pride yourself on your ability to complete avoid damage. Though that might be self-induced ego due to being bullied for being so short.  
 - You have a +2 bonus to Ddoge, and your Dodge Interrupt's Base Speed is reduced to 1. If its Speed is somehow raised, you may still always utilize it (though you can not add on links to your Dodge if its Speed would increase enough to become ineligible with them).

##### Specialist
You excel in a particular style of combat, and since noticing that strength you have focused on what you're best at, be it extraordinary kicks, incredible ki blasts, or graceful swordplay, you are a cut above the rest.

- Choose either Hand to Hand, Weapons, or Ki: Whichever one you choose has +2 Accuracy, -3 to its Stamina and/or Ki Costs, and +10% to its damage.
- Next, choose one of the two that you did not pick.  That category has -2 Accuracy, +2 to its Stamina and/or Ki Costs, and deals 10% less damage.
