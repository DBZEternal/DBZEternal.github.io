##### What Abilities Are
Abilities represent the fruits of your character's training, and the ways in which they've chosen to develop. What abilities you take will play a large role in shaping how you perform in combat and other situations.

Abilities are more specific than skills; they differ from powers in that while a power is a specific capability, any ability is a way of doing something or a permanent increase to how you perform overall.

Most abilities are passive improvements, making you able to do certain things better.

You may choose to 'not use' a given ability at any time, essentially a form of holding back.  You can also choose to use less than your total ranks of any given ability at any time, but if it is for an ability you declare, you must declare how much of it you are using (as simply declaring it ordinarily indicates you are ussing it at the maximum rank you have unlocked).

##### Purchasing Abilities
Abilities are acquired by spending XP. Some abilities will list only a "Base Cost"; for those abilities, you spend that much XP and acquire the ability, and that is it.

Others will list both a "Base Cost" and a "Scale." These abilities can be purchased more than once. The first time, you pay the Base Cost in XP; each future purchase has its cost increased by the Scale.

For example, the Enhanced Hearing ability has Base Cost 4, Scale 3. One rank of Enhanced Hearing would cost 4 XP. The second would cost (4+3) 7 XP, and the third would cost (4+3+3) 10 XP. So, the total XP spent to get all three ranks would be (4 + 7 + 10) 21 XP.

Abilities with more than one rank will also include a Limit entry. This is what controls how many ranks of the ability you can have. So, if an ability (such as Attentive) said "Research /5" and you had 12 ranks of Research, you could buy that ability twice.

Many abilities will include in their limit line a maximum, such as "Limit: CHA /10, max 4". This means that you may take that ability up to that many times (so in that example, 4).

Certain abilities will also say "Requires: (something)". You cannot take any ranks in that ability unless you meet the requirement.

## Ki

##### 1. Assault
#### -=[ Enlarged Ki Blast ]=-
The larger the blast, the *better* the blast, so they say.  This ability allows you to make better use of the sheer amount of Ki put into your attacks to better hit your intended target.  For every 10 points your Ki attacks cost, they gain +1 Accuracy, to a maximum of your ranks of this ability or the Ki attack's cost, whichever is lower.  (e.g., with 2 ranks of EKB, you would gain +2 to your Accuracy for Ki attacks costing 20 or more KE; you would need a third rank in order to get a +3 from Ki Attacks costing 30 or more).

 - Base cost: 15  
 - Scale: 5  
 - Limit: Offensive Ki Control / 5

#### -=[ Firepower ]=-
You are able to increase your Ki's density, causing your Ki attacks to inflict more damage by more efficiently forming and maintaining the energy until impact.  Each rank increases the damage your Ki Attacks deal by 1, but the total damage from this ability can not exceed the damage provided by your Damage bonus multiplied by the attack's speed (normally only an issue with low speed attacks).

 - Base Cost: 0  
 - Scale: 1  
 - Limit: Offensive Ki Control




#### -=[ Elemental Affinity ]=-
Every ninja has a natural affinity for one of the five primary elements, though some may not discover it until later. This ability can be taken for any one of the five elements, even one your character cannot use. For each rank, you get a +1 bonus to Chakra Exhaustion and Chakra Control rolls involving your favored element. The Chakra Control skill requirements to learn jutsu according to rank are considered 1 point lower, per rank, for your chosen element. Some clans start with a specific Elemental Affinity, giving them one rank in this ability. This does not (necessarily) provide them with the matching Elemental Aptitude, though it does mean they cannot change their affinity.

Base Cost: 0  
  - Scale: +1
  - Limit: CHA /20, max 5
  - Special: You may only take this ability for a single element, ever.
