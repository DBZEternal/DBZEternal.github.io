        <h2 id="creating-a-character">Creating a Character</h2>

<p>In order to ‘officially’ create a character, you must inform a member of staff (a ST or GM) and link them your character sheet.  This is both to add your character to an official roster kept by staff, and to have the staff quickly check over your sheet to ensure there are no issues with your character, unintentionally or otherwise, as it’s a complex game system and everyone can sometimes get things wrong (or simply forget parts of character creation). You can not go IC (In Character) or begin playing the game with others until a staff member has approved your character.</p>

<h2 id="time-is-different">Time is Different</h2>
<p>On a general level, time flows roughly seven times as fast in game as it does in real life.  Unless otherwise specificied, 1 OOC day = 1 IC week, and 7 OOC minutes = 1 IC hour.  Time passes differently while you are in a scene, however, and so things such as regeneration and healing that normally occur ‘per hour’ do not occur while you remain roleplaying and engaged in a RP scene: you must leave or end the RP scene in order to have healing occur.</p>

<p>100 IC roughly equates to 60 seconds, which means every IC equates to roughly 0.6 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-a-roleplaying-game">This is a ‘role’playing game</h2>
<p>While we do not enforce some elitist standard of what is “Acceptable” for roleplaying, you <b>are</b> expected to roleplay, not just roll dice.  It is expected that everyone puts effort to roleplay and be reasonably realistic and empathetic to how they interact with others.  For example, if someone cuts off your arm, react to it.  Don’t just talk, actually act as if your arm had been cut off! Get upset! Get freaked out! Get scared!  And express that in your characters voice and actions.</p>

<h2 id="character-sheet-logs">Character Sheet Logs</h2>

<p>Your Character Sheet Logs <b>MUST</b> be filled out, accurate, and kept that way throughout your time playing.  If you do not log a scene or a fight or an event, you do not get credit for it, and you can not claim credit if you do not mark the time, date, which channel/room it took place in, other participants, and what you got from it.</p>

<p>Failure to keep an up to date (and <em>legible</em>) sheet can result in penalties from a loss of experience points or worse.  If this becomes a habitual problem, your character may be removed from the roster and you may be banned from playing the game for creating an unfair play environment for others.  Do not let laziness (or a sense of competition) cause you to cheat or make the game worse for others just because you can not put in the effort or play fair with others.</p>

<p>However, this does not mean that a single minor miscalculation will get you declared illegal. If it’s obviously an honest mistake and hasn’t had any severe effect, you’ll probably receive a small penalty or none at all provided it’s fixed immediately when caught.  On the other hand, gross negligence or incomprehensible logs are no better than not filling out the logs at all.</p>

<p>Oh, and do not try to change the sheet’s formulas to spoof things within formulas that come pre-set on the sheet.  You WILL be caught and you will be immediately banned if you are found to be not only cheating, but trying to hide your cheating in such nefarious ways (trust us, it’s been done before, it’s been caught before, and it will be caught again).</p>

<h2 id="declare-your-actions">Declare your actions</h2>
<p>When you use an attack, you must state in parenthesis ( ) OOC what you are doing, regardless of what your character’s described action is, along with modifiers/add-ons to that action.  If you are throwing a Punch, you write your post, then add ( Punch ) to the end of it, either immediately after the final sentence or on a new line in the same post. this is to ensure your opponent understands what you’re doing and how they can respond (or how you are planning to respond to them). The rule of declarations is simple: If it alters your accuracy, damage, or how they might defend in any way, you declare it.  You do not, however, have to declare status effects that are a part of your attack (but you would have to declare the attack itself, so they could know by that what status effects might result).</p>

<p>Likewise, your attacks should be described within reason.  If you want your ki blasts to be fireballs: that’s fine.  If you want them to be beams of pure energy or lasers or spontaneous explosions, that’s okay too.  A ki attack should not, however, be a punch any more than a hand-to-hand attack should be shooting someone with eye lasers.  Be sensible with its appearance, but go nuts with its description.</p>

<h2 id="no-metagaming">No Metagaming</h2>
<p>Metaming means using out of character knowledge in character.  An example of this would be having your character know what other characters are planning even though your character was not there when two others discussed some evil plot, and you have your character automatically know of and react to information they were never told just because you read it yourself.  Another example of this would be assuming key facts of certain races when your character is not of that race and has not been told of their quirks, i.e., you should not assume you know of a Saiyan’s weakness for having their Tail grabbed, or cut off to stop them from transforming, unless you were told it by someone or you witness it happen (by watching a saiyan fight and seeing it happen in-character).</p>

<h2 id="honest-rollers">Honest Rollers</h2>
<p>It is very easy to mistakenly add something that doesn’t apply to a roll–such as a bonus you counted twice, or a conditional modifier that is included when it should be excluded. It is fine to shorten your rollers to a simple 1d20+X as one lump sum number, if someone requests you break down how you got to X, you must do so, explaining every part of the number (i.e., STAT/10 + Skill + Racial modifier, etc, listing the source and the amount) so they can verify your total is correct.  This is not to ‘accuse’ anyone of anything, but to keep everyone honest and catch small mistakes as they happen, which is inevitable.  Do not take it as an offense.</p>

<p>On that note, all rolls and bonuses with a decimal point are considered to be rounded down to a whole number, except for damage bonuses, which are rounded down to a single decimal point.  (i.e., +11.57 becomes +11, but a damage bonus of 11.57 would round down to 11.5)</p>

<h2 id="if-in-doubt-ask">If in doubt, ask</h2>
<p>If you’re not sure if you’re doing something right, just ask another player or a GM if they are available.  The PHB is heavily under construction and sometimes can be contradictory or difficult to read.  If you find something like this, refer to the appropriate discord channel for reporting on rules disrepencies, or the rules questions channel if you are unsure of how somethings works or interacts with other parts of the PHB.</p>
